If you are unsure, ask the user to choose.\n -- Re-send the exact same 'input' with NO modifications, and add the 'assumption' parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values.\n -- ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant 'Assumption' or other input suggestions are not provided.\n -- Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.\n",
